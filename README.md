# Virtual-Sound-Synth

Sound Synthesizer coded in C++ from scratch, using oscillators and envelopes, as well as polyphony implementation that allows you to play multiple notes at the same time. 

Allows users to access your computer audio hardware, and play music out of a harmonica/bell synth with the following piano keypresses on your keyboard. 

Use letters A to L and Z to M. The second keyboard row plays flat and sharp keys. The third keyboard row plays regular notes.  


ToDo: 
- Use Waveout API to smoothen out sound
- Implement piano interface in C++ console

Acknolwedgements: Uses header file from Javidx9 to access computer sound hardware
